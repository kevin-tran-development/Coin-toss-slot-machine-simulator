Coin Toss and Slot Machine Simulator Project

This project focuses on the princples of looping structures

 * - Purpose: To create a menu driven program that allows the user to select one of two following simulators to run or to quit the program. The first simulator is for tossing a coin multiple times and tracking the total number of heads and tails of the coin tosses. The second simulator is for a functioning slot machine.
 * 
 * - Input: Input for Coin Toss Machine: User input amount of coin tosses.
 * - Input for Slot Machine Simulator: User input for the amount of money to enter into the slot machine.
 * 
 * - Process: Process for Coin Toss Simulator: The Coin Toss simulator will randomize a specified number of times that the user has inputted. For each coin toss, it will display the toss number and the result of the coin toss of (head or tails).
 * - Process for Slot Machine Simulator: The slot machine will randomize a selection of fruits (cherries,oranges,plums,bells,melons, and bars). If two or more fruits matches, the user wins an amount of money that the slot machine dispenses back to the user.
 * 
 * - Output: Output for Coin Toss Simulator: The output will display the coin toss number according to the amount of tosses the user inputted and the result of the tosses. Will also display the amount of heads and tails at the end.
 * - Output for Slot Machine Simulator: The output will display three randomized fruits along with the results of whether or not if two or more fruits match and a prompt asking if they would like to play again or not. If they choose No, it will display the total amount deposited, total amount won and the net gain/loss total.
